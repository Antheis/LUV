A solo one-week clicker project

A minimalistic clicker where you're a robot exploring the human feelings.

It's really simplistic, a bit ugly, but I had a lot of fun doing it. And it's still a pretty personal work, despite the assignment origin.

Made using Unity. I also made the visuals (except the free font) and the musics. 

/!\ BEWARE /!\\
NOT BALANCED: didn't have the time to test it properly :p
Also the musics doesn't really match the ambiance (went a bit overboard, sry :3)
